# IOT-GATE
(multidisciplinary project) IOT-GATE is an NIDS for IOT networks


In this project we propose a solution for the cyber attacks on networks as a machine learning based Intrusion detection system(IDS) and it's splitted to two parts:


1.1- Capturing the network flows and Features extraction:

    In this part we use pyshark to capture the flow and extract the features ,and tweaked its ui for a simpler usage.

1.2- Prediction:

    In order to achieve the highest accuracy we splitted the task into two stages to respectively detect the anomaly then classify it to a list 
    of attacks we trained our model on, we used TON IOT Dataset to assure that we have the latest possible data on current cyber attacks.
